## ‚öôÔ∏è **How to Set Up the Project**

### Prerequisites:
1. **Java 17** or higher installed.
2. **Maven 3.8+** installed.
3. **MySQL** database instance.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kenu21/book-shop
   cd book-shop
   ```

2. Set up the database:
    - Create a new database named `book_shop`.
    - Update the database connection details in `application.properties`:
      ```properties
      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/book_shop
      spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
      spring.datasource.password=<your-password>
      ```

3. Run Liquibase migrations:
   ```bash
   mvn liquibase:update
   ```

4. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. Access the application:
    - Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
    - API documentation: [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)

- `GET /categories/{id}` - Get category details.
- `POST /categories` - Create a new category (admin only).
- `PUT /categories/{id}` - Update or create a category (admin only).
- `DELETE /categories/{id}` - Delete a category (admin only).

### **Orders**
- `POST /orders` - Place a new order (authenticated users).
- `GET /orders` - Retrieve all orders for the authenticated user.
- `PATCH /orders/{id}` - Update an order (admin only).
- `GET /orders/{id}/items` - Retrieve items for a specific order.

### **Shopping Cart**
- `GET /cart` - Retrieve the user's shopping cart.
- `POST /cart` - Add an item to the shopping cart.
- `PUT /cart/items/{id}` - Update an item's quantity in the cart.
- `DELETE /cart/items/{id}` - Remove an item from the cart.

## üåü **Challenges Faced**

1. **Role-Based Access Control**:
    - Solved by using `@PreAuthorize` annotations and integrating JWT seamlessly with Spring Security.
2. **Efficient DTO Mapping**:
    - Resolved by integrating **Mapstruct**, reducing boilerplate code.
3. **Database Version Control**:
    - Managed with **Liquibase**, ensuring a robust migration strategy for different environments.
